<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>I want to develop an intelligent small mobile robot，i would like to call him “Vita”. The main function is to solve some troubles caused by the owner who is busy in the family, but who is usually busy with work or study, and who does not stay at home for a long time. For example, when the owner is not at home, the pet dog will be very lonely at home, no one will play or chat with him, or often the water and food in his bowl are finished, and he can only wait until the owner returns home at night. At this time, Vita's existence is to give the dog more protection and companionship, but also to give the owner peace of mind.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<h3>The motivation for thinking about developing the “Vita” is that I am studying in Melbourne now. I also have a pet dog at home. I named him "Pepsi". Many times I need to go to class all day, although I have roommates at home, but I don't like to bother to take care of “Pepsi”. When no one is at home, when he is bored, he always bites a sofa or a napkin. He is very curious. I can not install the camera to watch its behaviour at all times, because the house that is currently living is rented, there is no way to install those cameras. On the other hand, if I sometimes need to submit an assignment, I will learn late with my classmates in the library. There is not enough water and food in the bowl of “Pepsi”, he will be very hungry and very anxious, this is the only thing which I am most afraid of encountering. In the same way, I have a lot of friends who are studying here, and they all have pet dogs. They all like to have pets, but we can't give enough pets to accompany them. This makes pets and us very troubled. So I hope I can use “Vita” to solve our troubles, and also reduce the anxiety of pets while giving more companionship.

<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Use "Vita", the user only needs to connect via the app downloaded on the phone. This app can completely control the movement speed of the intelligent robot, the amount of time and time of the feed and provide the editing of the movie. The intelligent robot has a high-definition camera and advanced real-time video calling function, so that the pet can communicate with the owner in real time through the intelligent robot, and the owner can monitor all the actions of the pet in real time through the camera to prevent the pet from accident at home. , messing around or destroying furniture. As soon as the pet makes a sound or destroys other things, Vita will immediately shake the owner's mobile phone to remind them to check the status of the pet. This app can record every moment of your pet, don't miss a precious picture, and share it with your friends. If you are going out to play with friends, you want to talk to your pet at home, you can open the app directly by clicking the dialogue button inside, and the pet can hear your kind voice through the speaker of "Vita". The "Vita" shell uses a high-strength polymer to prevent pets from biting it, and the "Vita" body is equipped with a sensitive sensor. Once the pet tries to destroy the "Vita", the "Vita" will immediately throw out the pet dog favourite. The toy ball attracts the pet's attention by playing with their favourite dog catching game. If the pet puts the toy ball back into the recycling box on the "Vita", it will immediately give the pet a small amount of snacks as a reward. Even if the "Vita" is too low, it will find and automatically move to a small wireless charging station for automatic charging through the infrared function installed in the body. It takes only 15 minutes to fully charge each time.

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<h3>Making "Vita" requires a lot of engineering and programming, as well as advanced imaging and audio chips, and these programs must be connected together. Wheels are also needed, motors include motors, and rechargeable batteries that can be recycled continuously, and are equipped with WI-FI link excuses, as well as infrared and Bluetooth connectivity devices.

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<h3>If this project is really successful, I think it can help many pet workers or students, and it can definitely reduce the incidence of anxiety or depression in pets. But there are some problems. If so many complicated programs are connected together, it will reduce the error that the owner is using the app to interact with the pet. For example, the mobile app cannot connect to the "Vita", or the "Vita" lacks the power to automatically find the wireless charging station correctly. These problems all take time to experiment once and for all, everything needs to go through failure to succeed, but I believe I can be perfect.
