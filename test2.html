<h2> • IDEA JOB</h2>   
<h3>My idea job is do the “Information Technology Business Analyst”, Coincidentally, I am finding the job on the TalentInternational Website, the job name is “Sharepoint Developer/Support Analyst <a href="https://au.talentinternational.com/jobs/sharepoint-developer-slash-support-analyst ">(Type Here)</a>.It is belongs to the Information & Communication Technology, the reason of why this internal work can attract me is I want to is innovation, to solve the problems and develop different apps for different customers.
</h3>
<h3> Therefore, about this job, what should I to do is the experience with Sharepoint (on-premises) development and management, understanding of IT, software development lifecycle and project management methods, including agile and the most important is I need have the powerful solution implementation and delivery skills. I think I have now learned to analyse some of the expertise, such as a company's web page, to find out the shortcomings and advantages of this page, what aspects I can improve, and what I can learn about their technology and ideas.In addition, HTML and JAVA are programming software that I am very interested in to make web pages more secure. HTML pages are not affected by Asp-related vulnerabilities and ease the burden on the server. However, this is too simple. Unable to adapt to the needs of more network devices and applications. For example, mobile phones, PDAs, and information devices cannot display HTML directly. Second, I need to spend some energy on more internships because information technology business analysts need teamwork and problem-solving skills very much, because in many cases we can't do it alone, for example if a company's network is very Large vulnerabilities, repairing vulnerabilities is a great need for a team to coordinate and cooperate. These are all I need to accumulate in the future work experience. In today's society, the more developed the technology, the more bad guys there are, which gives us young people the opportunity to create more powerful and safer programming software. Before that, I should be proficient in existing programming. Only by learning the basics can I imagine or create more and update something. Third, I need to be humble, because only a modest attitude can go to study with my smart IT talents, and you need to gain programming experience in the actual project, and record the other people's code every day, because write The impression that comes down will be deeper than reading alone. Go to a favorite project every year, learn a programming language and contact fast typing every year, because we have to face the keyboard every day. If I can, I am very willing to improve myself, enter the company to study hard and provide better services to customers, and help them improve their company's network vulnerabilities, because information security applies to any company. An important thing, I hope I can be accepted by this company, I will be on time even day, because I  am living in Melbourne city, it is very close from company, I believe I can competent this job, please give me a chance, thank you.</h3>

<h3>These results show that I am an imaginative, open-minded person with a kind heart. In today's society, no matter whether life is still at work, everyone's ideas are different. We don't know whether the people we meet are good or bad. Even if I am a homeless person, I will give him the right. Respect, because parents teach me from an early age, it is important to respect everyone. And I don't like to just imagine, I prefer to practice it.
