        <h2> ‚Ä¢ INTERTST IN IT</h2>
        <h3> ‚û§ What is your interest in IT?</h3>
        <strong><p>Nowadays, society has a large demand for IT technicians. The IT industry is constantly emerging with new technologies, and professionals are in a state of want. Nowadays, society has become an information age. Almost everyone can't leave technology and can't leave mobile phones and computers. Without the technology created by IT, people will stay in an era without network information, and IT will make people's lives, and become more and more colourful. Because of this, I began to like technology and like IT. I hope that by learning IT, I will create new and innovative technologies and make a contribution to this society. There have been many business opportunities in the emergence of IT. For example, many online shopping websites, dating websites and online banking have made people's lives more convenient and faster, and promoted the economic development of society.

        <h3> ‚û§ When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
        <strong><p>When I was young, my mom gives me a Apple iPod ‚Ö°Ôºåthat is my first Technology Product. Before that, I only saw mobile phones with black and white screens, that is the first time I've experienced the power of technology. I can download a lot of apps on my iPod. Since then, I have had a great interest in technology products. It wasn't until I got to high school that I started to get in touch with IT, touched programming, felt the charm of IT, wanted to learn IT in college, and learned programming. I hope that one day I can also make a technology product that makes everyone happy.

        <h3> ‚û§ Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3> 
        <strong><p>RMIT is the only university institution in Australia to be awarded the royal title by the British Empire. RMIT is located in the heart of Melbourne, it is very convenient for me to study abroad and RMIT is a high-graduate university in Australia. And RMIT's bachelors of Engineering and Technology are located in the top 100 worldwide universities. In my opinion, RMIT‚Äôs IT and CS are the best, because the quality of teachers here is terrific, and the teaching equipment is advanced, the concept of study is advancing with the times, and the learning environment during class is excellent. It has a long history and talented people, such as Daniel Almagor (founder and manager of the Australian Borderless Engineering Council), Jacques Nasser (CEO of Ford Motor Company) and Dr Bob Isherwood (Global Creative Director of Saatchi & Saatchi).

        <h3> ‚û§ What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>   
        <strong><p>Firstly, I want to learn the importance of information security, I want to know how to protect the personal information. Because there are lots of hackers in our daily life try to steal our information, like bank details, password, private photos or videos. I would like to learn some measures to protect network information security.
                Secondly, I want to study Learn how to assess existing technologies in the business, solve problems, and implement new information technologies. Because I need to learn how can find the errors in existing technologies, then I can do the best technology than these, in order      to reduce technology vulnerabilities and give users a better experience.
